Different nursing qualifications have different employment outcomes. You could choose to become an Enrolled Nurse, a Registered Nurse (RN), a midwife or even a Medication Endorsed Enrolled Nurse (EEN).
            Nurses are in high demand globally and in Australia, and consistently feature in the skills shortage list for Australian PR.
            Due to the high demand for Registered nurses as with other sectors of nursing, these occupations are listed consistently in the Skilled Occupations List (SOL) and the Consolidated Sponsored Occupations List (CSOL). These include Registered Nurse (Medical Practice), Registered Nurse (Aged Care), and Nurse Practitioner. As most visa types, an assessment procedure by a recognised authority (Australian Nursing and Midwifery Accreditation Council, ANMAC for Registered nurses and practitioners) is required as part of the visa application for work or migration purpose such as Permanent Residency.

        text: `<p>Australia had always taken pride for providing high quality education. Australian Nurse Programs had been meticulously developed to impart theoretical knowledge and hone practical skills required in delivering excellent healthcare services.</p>

                <br />
                
                <p>High demands for qualified nurses and related healthcare services, as reflected in Skilled Occupations List, is one of the driving factors for its popularity. Relevant educational background, work experiences maybe counted towards application of Permanent Residency.</p>
                
                <br />
                
                <p>Another appealing reason for practicing nurses to consider Australia is the Bridging Program for Nurses or popularly known as IRON (Initial Registration for Overseas Nurses). Overseas nurses coming from different backgrounds and practice are prepared thoroughly to be integrated into the Australian workforce.&nbsp; It strengthens their existing knowledge and skills; orient them to best practise methods in their field; and make them aware of their conduct and legal responsibilities in the practise of their profession in Australia.</p>
                
                <br />
                
                <p>Also as the third most preferred destination for international students, the country continues to attract international students and tourists alike because of the culture, the sceneries, the laid back atmosphere and the unique flora and fauna and the thousand and one reasons why Australia is the place to be.</p>
                
                <br />
                
                <p>It is good to note that most international students can work for up to forty (40) hours every two weeks during semester and unrestricted hours during any scheduled course break and public holidays.</p>
