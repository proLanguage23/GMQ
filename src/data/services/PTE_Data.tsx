PTE is a form of examination that helps prove his/her ability to understand the English Language in all the four aspects, such as Reading, Listening, Writing and Speaking. Earlier, only IELTS was a medium for students to assess their English competency level. However, the DIBP (Department of Immigration and Border Protection) has focused on the PTE examination as well. As a result, candidates opting to lead their life internationally are undertaking the Pearson Test of English Exam to satisfy their eligibility requirements for the English language.`,
